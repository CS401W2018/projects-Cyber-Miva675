            1: Different ways to select an item.
            <p>- You can select an item for styling through several main ways like; the element selectors (using tags to select specific elements only),
            Universal selector (using a * to select every html element for styling of the whole page), ID selectors (uses the ID attribute that applies
            to a specific element for styling withing the page in the format, #, character and the element ID) and Class selectors (selecting specific
            class attributes for styling that applies to multiple elements withing the page using . character, and the class name).
            </p>

            2: Difference between ID and class.
            <p>-ID tag and CLASS tag are both used to add style to elements in html. However, an ID tag is a selector used to select only a specific element
            within the page for styling, while a class tag is a selector that selects a specific class attribute that applies to multiple elements within
            the page for styling.
            </p>

            3: Difference between a SPAN tag and a DIV tag.
            <p>-A SPAN tag and a DIV tag are both used for styling a group of elements together. However a SPAN tag is used to give styling for a grpup of elements,
            mostly with smaller texts within paragraphs and it doesn;t create new lines, while a DIV tag is used to style a group of elements together often
            used for larger texts, and it usually create new lines when text is too long for a given width of the page.
            </p>

            4: Difference between a DIV tag and a HEADER, MAIN, or FOOTER.
            <p>-A DIV tag is a non-semantic tag that gives style to elements within but does not describe the contents or have meaning. Semantic elements like; the
            header representing the top layers, the main representing the body of the page and the footer representing the bottom of the page give meaning to and
            describe the contents within them. However, the header, main and footer are used for the html layers while the DIV tag is used for the css styling and layout.
            </p>

            5: Different ways to select a color.
            <p>- There are different ways to select a color when using css. Some of the common ways to select colors are; NAMED colors, HEX colors, RGB, RGBa, HSL, and HSLa.
            When using NAMED colors, you can select a color simple by typing the color name, (for example: red) within the color tag. When using HEX colors, you can add
            colors by using the hexa-decimal values 0-f (for example: 1199ff). When using RGB (Red, Green, Blue), you use the primary colors to create precise colors
            (for example: R:100, G:250, B:125). Using HSL (Hue, Saturaton, Lightness), you can select different range of colors by editing the hue, saturation and lightness.
            However, when using RGB and HSL to select a color you often see a letter 'a' after the initials, for example; RGBa or HSLa. This is a symbol of transparancy
            in colors when editing.
