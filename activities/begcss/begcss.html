        <h1>CSS</h1>

        <p><h2>1: Inclined, embedded and Extenal</h2><p>
            <br>
            <p>-An inclined CSS is used inside a specific elements's style attribute.
            An internal CSS affects the whole web page but is used inside a style
            tag within the head section. However, an external CSS is constant across 
            many pages which is a seperate file linked with HTML documents within the
            same folder.</p>

        <p><h2>2: Why we should only use external CSS</h2>
            <br>
            <p>-There are various cascades to use in CSS, however, the external CSS is
            highly recommended to use. It has a lesser chance for saving caches, avoiding
            old files to be recognized quicker by google than the new ones. Having the cascades
            in a different file avoid caches to be saved, and a faster load of the websites.</p>

        <p><h2>3: What is a selector used for?<h2></p>
            <br>
           <p>-When adding style, a selector helps to find a specific HTML element. There are various
            selectors like simple selector, cimbinator selector, pseudo-class selector, pseudo elements
            selector and attribute selectors.</p>
