            <h1>My Answers to the questions</h1>

            <li>1: JPEG format is better to use when encoding photos with more details and colors. Often used for photos 
                containing people, photos with nature like the sunsets, travel photos, sports, etc.</li><br>
                
            <li>2: GIF is mostly used with encoding photos with less colors, such as logos, short animations and icons.
                It can often be used for images with low qualities or limited colors because of its 256 color limit.</li><br>
            
            <li>3: PNG format is most common for web pages  because of its unique factors used for pages with high qualities, transparency
                and detailed graphics. It often displays low quality photos before displaying the high quality ones, giving an easy
                experince for the users.</li><br>
           
            <li>You can resize photos through your apps or softwares on your computer, such as photo editor and photoshops, or you can use the
                css(cascading spreadsheets) to resize, such as editing their widths and heights.</li><br>

            <li> Instead of using css, it is better to use photo editing softwares to resize your photos. It is because using css can stretch the photos
                and affect the shape of the photos, while you can view the photo and edit it at the same time in a photo editing software.</li><br>
