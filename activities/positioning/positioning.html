            The world map is a visual representation of Earth's surface, showing 
            continents, countries, oceans, and other geographical features. It helps
            people understand the layout of the planet and the relationships between
            different regions. World maps come in various forms, including political
            maps, which highlight country borders, and physical maps, which show mountains,
            rivers, and other natural features. Since the Earth is round, cartographers use
            different map projections to represent it on a flat surface, but each projection
            has some distortion. Maps are essential tools for navigation, education, and 
            global communication, helping people explore and connect with the world.

            <h2>MY ANSWERS TO THE 5 QUESTIONS</h2>
            <li>In html, the normal flow is the way or style the various elements are
                displayed and shown on a webpage. Often refering to block elements and inline elements
                that always stay in line when coding.</li><br>

            <li>float moves an element left or right, allowing text to wrap around it. Clearing the float
                prevents layout issues.</li><br>

            <li>Absolute moves an element based on its nearest positioned ancestor.
                Fixed keeps an element in place even when scrolling, and the 
                Relative moves an element based on its original position.</li><br>

            <li>Use responsive design, a hamburger menu, and larger buttons for easy tapping.</li><br>

            <li>Check your class website, YouTube (Traversy Media, The Net Ninja), or W3Schools
            for tutorials.</li><br>
