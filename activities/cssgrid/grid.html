                <li><b>What should you focus on during class and after class?</b></li>
                -During class we should be focusing on the important parts of the current
                units such as the CSS grid topic in Web Design. Focusing more on that can
                improve our skills on web designing, specifically on coding. After class,
                we should be focusing on creating a new webpage using CSS grid as our new 
                project. We should create required pages like the html doc and the linked
                Cascading spreadsheeet. Understanding this can help in securing a great job
                with a clear understanding about coding in the future.

                <li><b>What is the main difference between CSS Grid and CSS Flex?</b></li>
                -A CSS grid is two dimensional while the CSS flex is one dimensional.
                CSS grid allows the parent elements to give specific commands to the 
                child elements in which they strictly obey.Often causing the content
                to overlap or be shorten if it is large in size. However, a CSS flex 
                parent elements allows a content within to enlarge if necessaary due
                to the content having larger size.
