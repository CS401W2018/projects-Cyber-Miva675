    <h1>Hello, my name is Trevor Miva</h1>
    <P>I was born in Port Moresby, <abbr title = "P.N.G">Papua New Guinea</abbr> in the early 2000s.
       To most of my friends, I am known as Cyber Miva.Growing up as a kid,
       I was always <q>obsessed</q> with sports and events all over the world.
       Watching games and events on TV and going to sports fields to watch games
       was my favorite thing to do. Seeing them as <dfn>role models</dfn> in 
       <dfn>great admirations</dfn>, I wanted to be like them one day.
    </P>   
        
    <p>Today I have developed a much greater interest in sports, often interacting
       in games and other fun activities. people like <strong>Michael Jordan</strong>, <strong>Wally Louis</strong>,
       <strong>Mike Tyson</strong>, <strong>Christiano Ronaldo</strong> and <strong>Usain Bolt</strong> are the GOATS
       of all time in sports I really look up to. They are the people who inspired me to look beyond my potentialin 
       sports and everything in life. Something I usually do to endure my interest in sports is to do regular exercise &lt;3hours/day, 
       keeping my fitness and being healthy enouhg to participate in regular sporting activities. 
       Aside from other small hobbies and interests,sports has become a major interest of mine. Some of
       the sporting games I mostly interact with are listed below.
