        <p>I chose this topic because I want to create a website about my home town,
        Port Moresby, which is in Papua New Guinea. I wan to create a website that people
        can create a tourist account in Papua New Guinea that can grant them discounts to accomodations
        and prioritize their reservations for easy check-in and stress free. This allows people to see 
        the good about my country. Not only about the beauty of the natural environments, but also the 
        good about the people. Images and GPS(or location) are provided.</p>
